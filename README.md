# Customizable Countdown Timer

A feature-rich and visually appealing countdown timer built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This application allows users to create multiple personalized countdowns for various events such as birthdays, holidays, sports events, or any custom occasion. Users can customize themes, edit existing countdowns, and share their countdowns with others. All countdowns are saved in `localStorage` to ensure persistence across sessions.
